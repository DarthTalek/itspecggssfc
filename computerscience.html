It involves the design, implementation, and application of computational systems and algorithms to solve problems and create solutions..</p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">At its core, computer science is about using computers and other technologies to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. This includes everything from developing new algorithms and software to creating new technologies and applications. </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">In a year 7 and 8 ICT class, students will typically be introduced to the fundamental concepts of computer science, such as algorithms, data structures, and programming languages. They will learn about how computers work and how to complete simple tasks.</p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">One of the key skills that students will develop in a computer science class is problem-solving. This involves identifying a problem, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts, and then creating a solution using computational tools and techniques. This skill is essential for anyone interested in pursuing a career in computer science, as it is the foundation of all computational work.</p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">Another important aspect of computer science is the ability to think logically and systematically. This involves using logical reasoning and critical thinking skills to solve complex problems, and to develop and test solutions. This skill is essential for anyone working in the field of computer science, as it is the basis of all computational work.</p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">In addition to these core skills, students in a computer science class will also learn about the different programming languages that are used to write computer programs. These include languages such as Java, Python, and C++, which are widely used in the industry for a variety of applications.</p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">Overall, computer science is a fascinating and rewarding field that offers many exciting career opportunities. By studying computer science, students can develop the skills and knowledge they need to pursue a career in this exciting and dynamic field.</p>
